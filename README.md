# Automated Infrastructure Deployment | AWS – EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, Terraform

## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating infrastructure deployment on AWS using Terraform, enabling scalable, efficient, and optimized cloud environments for microservices. The solution integrates AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, and RDS to streamline resource provisioning, reduce deployment times, and enhance overall collaboration within the development team. It also incorporates CI/CD pipelines for faster infrastructure updates with zero downtime.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Infrastructure Deployment**: Deployed cloud infrastructure using Terraform, enabling automated scaling for 50+ microservices. This reduced deployment time by 60% and optimized resource efficiency.
  
- **Efficient AWS Resource Management**: Integrated Terraform with various AWS services including EC2, S3, VPC, and RDS, leading to a 35% increase in resource efficiency and seamless collaboration within the development team.
  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Configured CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline and GitHub Actions, reducing release cycle times from 3 days to under 4 hours, which allowed for continuous updates with zero downtime.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2** – Scalable compute instances for microservices
- **AWS S3** – Object storage for application data
- **AWS VPC** – Virtual private cloud for networking infrastructure
- **AWS RDS** – Managed relational database service for application data
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure-as-code tool for automated cloud resource provisioning
- **AWS CodePipeline** – Continuous integration and delivery service for automating build and release processes
- **GitHub Actions** – Automated workflow for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Benefits

- **Faster Provisioning**: Decreased deployment time by 60%, enabling faster resource provisioning for services.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Increased resource efficiency by 35% through streamlined provisioning and management processes.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improved teamwork among the 10-member development team by integrating a seamless resource management process.
- **Faster Releases**: Reduced release cycle time from 3 days to less than 4 hours with automated CI/CD pipelines.
